Abstract : 

Statistical models employed to predict the performance of sports professionals in order to maximize organizational performance is something that is not new, but seems to be going through a renaissance of sorts. This is most likely due to the vast amount of granular data that is now being recorded that necessitates data analysis methods designed to sort through large amount of data quickly and effectively in order to create the best possible predictive models. This paper deals with the utilization of Major League Baseball (MLB) team seasonal aggregate total statistical data to predict how many total wins they will achieve. 

Introduction: 

Data analysis in baseball is currently extremely prevalent to the point where players will walk off the field after a success or failure and into the dugout, where they will use some sore of personal computer to visualize the breakdown in metrics that describe the dynamics of their approach in order to understand in near-real time how they can modify their approach to increase performance. Pitchers watch extremely slowed down footage with metrics of data time histories of their arm angle, spin rates, release points, and others in order to improve their pitching. Certain broadcasts of baseball games have recently begun including the results of predictive algorithms on screen that display the likelihood of a current batter being successful. This surge in data science applied to baseball is associated closely with the introduction of Statcast, a subsidiary of MLB which records all of this highly detailed data in game and stores the data public for all to access.
